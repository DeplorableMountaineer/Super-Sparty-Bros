Platformer game for Coursera/MSU Game Development for Modern Platforms course project


From the course page:

> Welcome to [Game Development for Modern Platforms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/gamedev-platforms/home/welcome)! The goal of this course is to level up your game making skills beyond beginner status and prepare you to larger scale games for a variety of platforms and bring them to market. Creating games is a truly rewarding experience and I am happy you have decided to take this journey with me and the other learners taking this course.
